# SpaceX_Machine_Learning_Prediction
Notebook Description

This notebook explores the application of machine learning algorithms to classify data. It begins with data preprocessing steps, including data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering. The dataset contains information about various features, and the target variable is categorical.

The notebook then proceeds to model training and evaluation using four different algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). For each algorithm, hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

After training the models, the notebook evaluates their performance on a test dataset using accuracy as the evaluation metric. Finally, it compares the performance of all models to determine which one performs best on the given task.
